## Local Development Setup

### Frontend

See cdc-frontend for frontend setup.

### Backend

To run the backend server:

```
todo
```

To call any APIs that require authentication without the frontend running (ex. using curl or Postman), you'll need an access token. You can generate a token for your account this with the command:

```
todo
```

This script will output a JSON object – you can use the `idToken` value and provide it as a bearer token to your API calls. This token expires every hour, and you can rerun this script to generate a new one.
