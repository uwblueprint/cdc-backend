You were able to find ways to include them in class and passed them a resource they could possibly use. To learn more about ConnecTeen please visit our website <a href='https://calgaryconnecteen.com'>here</a>.",
      "paragraph_text": "By solving the puzzles and going through the room, you have learnt important skills such as recognizing signs of stress and physical cues, being more inclusive and creating a safe space. You also learnt about some techniques you can use to reach out to peers who are distressed. When someone is in a crisis, it is hard to see options and ask for help. The person may feel like they don't deserve help, may talk down to themself, and experience low self-esteem when going through a challenging time. During these times, you can use the strategies you learnt about today such as recognizing signs, reaching out and asking open-ended questions about common interests to help them feel better. You should also remind them it is okay to reach out for help and support - their friends as well as Calgary ConnecTeen are available for their support.",
