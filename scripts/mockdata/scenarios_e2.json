    "description": "You find yourself sitting at your desk needing to find a way out. The History Teacher is talking about the paper that is due in a week, you look down and see you haven't even started writing your paper. You think back to the fact that you still have one Biology lab, one Math quiz and one Chemistry exam in the same week. The room begins to feel like it's slanting, your palms are sweating, you feel your heart beating faster and your hands begin to shake - how will you escape and find help?",

You were able to find support for the character and got some insight on what it can be like if you are in a crisis. To learn more about ConnecTeen please visit our website <a href='https://calgaryconnecteen.com'>here</a>.",
      "paragraph_text": "By solving the puzzles and going through the room, you have learnt important skills such as being aware of triggers (many tasks, lots of school work), techniques you can use when having an anxiety attack, and helpful resources. When you are in a crisis, it is hard to see options and ask for help. You may feel like you don't deserve help, may talk down to yourself, and experience low self-esteem when going through a challenging time. During these times, you can use the coping strategies you learnt about today such as music, reading, music and journaling to help feel better. You should also remember that it is okay to reach out for help and support - your friends as well as Calgary ConnecTeen are available for your support.",
