    "description": "A volunteer is going through the application and recruitment process for the ConnecTeen program and goes through a series of events that gets them to supporting another youth in crisis. (i.e. You are so stoked as you have been looking forward to volunteering with ConnecTeen when you turned 15 years old. You have been in crisis before and have used the service in the past to get through some dark times and now that you are feeling better you want to support others who are going through the same thing. The application and recruitment process is a lot more extensive than you originally thought and it’s taken you about 2 and a half months before you could even take your first solo shift. Now that you are on your first shift, a youth tells you they are at risk for suicide – how will you support the youth in your new role?",

You were able to find ways to include them in class and passed them a resource they could possibly use. Below are some take away points from the escape room. To learn more about ConnecTeen please visit our website <a href='https://calgaryconnecteen.com'>here</a>.",
      "paragraph_text": "By solving the puzzles and going through the room, you have learnt important skills such as recognizing that when people feel uncomfortable or stressed, they can demonstrate it in different ways. Being able to take a step back from time to time, observe your surroundings and checking in on people is a great way to connect with someone. Sometimes its hard to ask for help, taking steps to provide that helping hand out first can make it seem less scary. It's a lot harder to connect with people when you use close-ended questions, try open end-ended questions. It's always important to create space for everyone, if someone is having a hard time making space for themselves you can help include them by giving them the floor to speak. If you're not sure how to support someone its okay to refer people to community resources.",
